# Hugging Face Hub Chatbot AI

## Overview
This project implements a **Chatbot AI** powered by Hugging Face models, allowing users to interact with an intelligent conversational agent. The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art NLP models such as **GPT, T5, or BlenderBot** to generate human-like responses.

## Features
- Natural language understanding and response generation
- Integration with Hugging Face Transformers and pre-trained models
- Customizable chatbot personality and behavior
- API and CLI support for seamless integration
- GPU acceleration for fast inference

## Usage

### CLI Usage
Run the chatbot interactively:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

### API Usage
You can also interact with the chatbot via an API:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/chat", json={"message": "Hello, how are you?"})
data = response.json()
print(data["response"])
```

### Configuration
Modify the chatbot settings in `config.yaml` to adjust model parameters, temperature, response length, and personality traits.

## Deployment
You can deploy the chatbot as a web service using **FastAPI or Flask**:
```bash
python app.py
```
Or, deploy it on **Hugging Face Spaces** for cloud-based interaction.
